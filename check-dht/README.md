# Check DHT Sensor Example

This is a simple example from [UncleRus](https://github.com/UncleRus) repository for typical DHT sensors (e.g DHT22, DTHT11, AM2302, etc.), to check if they work with ESP32 chip and [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

If you need an Arduino example please check [Arduino DHT library](../Arduino/libraries/SimpleDHT/examples) folder.
